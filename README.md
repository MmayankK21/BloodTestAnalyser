# Blood Test Report Analysis

## Overview
This FastAPI application processes blood test reports using a custom CrewAI implementation that supports various LLMs (Llama 3 via Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). The system uses specialized AI agents to provide comprehensive health analysis. This solution fixes numerous bugs from the original implementation and provides a robust, production-ready API.

## Comprehensive Bug Fixes

### Critical Architecture Issues
1. **Undefined LLM Variable**  
   The original code contained `llm = llm` which caused immediate failure since `llm` was never defined.  
   **Fix**: Implemented a custom execution flow that bypasses CrewAI's LLM system entirely.

2. **CrewAI Internal Conflicts**  
   Persistent "LLM Provider NOT provided" errors due to CrewAI's LiteLLM integration conflicts.  
   **Fix**: Created a complete custom execution pipeline that avoids CrewAI's internal LLM handling.

3. **Tool Implementation Flaws**  
   - Missing `@tool` decorator and improper base class inheritance  
   - PDFLoader not imported causing runtime crashes  
   **Fix**: Proper `BaseTool` implementation with Pydantic schema validation and explicit imports.

### Agent & Task System Defects
4. **Single Agent Overload**  
   All tasks were incorrectly assigned to the Doctor agent.  
   **Fix**: Implemented specialized task assignments:
   ```python
   verification = Task(agent=verifier)
   nutrition_analysis = Task(agent=nutritionist)
   ```

5. **Unprofessional Personas**  
   Agents had unrealistic backstories encouraging misinformation.  
   **Fix**: Revised to evidence-based professional profiles:
   ```python
   backstory=(
       "You are a certified clinical nutritionist with 15+ years of experience. "
       "You provide science-backed dietary recommendations based on blood reports."
   )
   ```

6. **Delegation Mismanagement**  
   Incorrect `allow_delegation` settings prevented proper collaboration.  
   **Fix**: Configured delegation based on agent specialization needs.

### File Processing Problems
7. **Temporary File Accumulation**  
   Uploaded files remained in `data/` directory after processing.  
   **Fix**: Implemented UUID-based storage with guaranteed cleanup:
   ```python
   finally:
       if os.path.exists(file_path):
           os.remove(file_path)
   ```

8. **Missing File Validation**  
   Non-PDF files could be uploaded causing processing errors.  
   **Fix**: Added strict file type validation:
   ```python
   if not file.filename.lower().endswith('.pdf'):
       raise HTTPException(400, "Only PDF files accepted")
   ```

9. **Messy Text Extraction**  
   PDF extraction produced unreadable content with excessive whitespace.  
   **Fix**: Implemented content normalization:
   ```python
   content = re.sub(r'\n{3,}', '\n\n', content)
   content = re.sub(r' {2,}', ' ', content)
   ```

### API & Execution Flaws
10. **Inconsistent Variable Formatting**  
    Prompts used different formatting styles causing input mismatches.  
    **Fix**: Unified input handling with `.format(**inputs)`.

11. **Generic Error Handling**  
    Errors provided no actionable debugging information.  
    **Fix**: Added detailed traceback logging:
    ```python
    except Exception as e:
        traceback.print_exc()
        return f"Crew execution failed: {str(e)}"
    ```

12. **Resource Management Gaps**  
    No constraints on agent execution causing potential infinite loops.  
    **Fix**: Added execution limits:
    ```python
    max_iter=5,  # Prevent infinite loops
    max_rpm=10   # Rate limiting
    ```

13. **API Response Inconsistency**  
    Response structure varied between successful and failed executions.  
    **Fix**: Standardized JSON output format:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success|error",
      "query": "User query",
      "analysis": "Content",
      "file_processed": "filename.pdf"
    }
    ```

### Content Quality Issues
14. **Prompt Engineering Defects**  
    Vague task descriptions led to low-quality outputs.  
    **Fix**: Implemented detailed professional prompts:
    ```python
    description="Provide science-based nutrition advice...",
    expected_output="Personalized nutrition plan with references"
    ```

15. **Tool Argument Confusion**  
    Tools expected hardcoded paths instead of uploaded files.  
    **Fix**: Implemented dynamic path handling:
    ```python
    inputs = {'query': query, 'file_path': file_path}
    ```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- LLM Access:
  - **Local**: Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
  - **Cloud**: Obtain API key (OpenAI/Anthropic)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blood-test-analysis.git
cd blood-test-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For local LLMs:
ollama pull llama3
```

### Configuration (.env)
```ini
# Choose one LLM provider:
LLM_TYPE=ollama       # openai|anthropic|ollama
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3

# For cloud providers:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
```

### Running the Application
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
